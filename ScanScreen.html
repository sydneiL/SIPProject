            <h2>Exceed Your Expectations</h2>

        <p>Your education is your own endurance.
        I am a diligent, ambitious student with many passions while on my journey to graduation this year with my Bachelor of Science in Computer Science. 
        However, what I love most in life is learning about new subjects and skill sets. I am here to show you what I have learned regarding website designs and prototypes and software application development, and hopefully be able to ignite your interest in computer science and other fields of technological science. 
        Positivity is the key to success.

                 <p>Innovation In Education</p>
    
    
    
                     <p>Creator:
    
                <p>Sydnei Lang, Advanced Computer Science</p>
    
    
    
                     <p> September 27,2023</p>
    
    
    
    
    
                   <p>TECHNICAL FIELD</p>
    
    
    
    
<p>This project involves the technical fields of computer science and virtual reality by scanning identities via voice recognition. Communication technology has advanced so much that we now have the capability of recognizing voices using translators and other devices.
    
    
</p>    
             
              
<p>BACKGROUND INFORMATION</p> 
    
    
    
<p>The inspirations for the development and creation of this innovation project are language mobile applications like FluentU, Babbel, Rosetta Stone, and voice recognition applications such as iRecord, iTranslate, and AutoVoice.
     My reasons for pursuing this project are my passion for languages and mobile applications and their simple yet professional interface layouts for people who are still ignorant of mobile application technology and their benefits to the world of education and communication.
    
    
    
</p>    
    

<p>
    <p>PRIOR ART</p> 
    
    
    
    <p>The sources of inspiration for my project are the language and voice recognition mobile applications currently on the market such as DuoLingo, Babbel, Rosetta Stone, AutoVoice, iRecord, and iTranslate, which would be considered competitors. The pros and cons of using DuoLingo are that the pros are the application being accessible, simultaneous learning of multiple languages, and no cost to anything on the application.
         The cons are many in that this application focuses on speaking English, only for beginning learners and not meant for advanced language learners, and language learning is limited by only being able to use some basic phrases and vocabulary. 
         The pros of using Babbel are its excellent amount of learning content, informative, educational podcasts, and its flexible and intuitive application design layout whereas the cons are the increased cost when wanting to learn multiple languages, no set number of content per languages, and the limited language courses available.
        The pros of using Rosetta Stone are that this application helps users tap into their innate language abilities to learn, ensuring users are comfortable with communication in reality offline, and users surrounding themselves with whatever specific language they choose. The cons of using Rosetta Stone are this application not applying to advanced linguists, lacking cultural honorifics and context for languages such as Chinese, Japanese, and Korean, and the repetitive, outdated, and the overall obscene costs for subscribing to the application.
       Though I obtained inspiration from this known language applications, mine is different from the majority of applications on the market as consumers will have free choice of what languages they wish to pursue, both written and spoken plus the lessons on my language application will be activated by voice and speech patterns only, especially useful for people belonging to the audibly and speech impaired communities. People worldwide who are deaf or mute need a mobile application that includes them in the linguistics category as well as everyone and anyone who wants to master languages of the world.
    </p>
</p>    
    
    
<p>               <p> PROJECT DESCRIPTION</p> 
    
    
    
<p>The full deliverable of this project would be a working prototype of an application with the eventual inclusion of an AI chatbot activated by voice that would increase the user experience for my audience. My project will also entail that it will possess effective virtual communication and scanning abilities benefiting my consumers by helping them become masterful of linguistics and vocal scanning as well as learning whatever languages they are fluent in from birth or languages that are mandatory for users to increase their educational and employment opportunities. 
</p>   
</p>    
    
               
<p>                  <p> INNOVATION CLAIM</p> 
    
    
    
<p> ScanScreen will be innovative in the abilities it would give the user to decide what languages they want to activate speaking whatever language they want to learn using their voice, regardless of how impaired their speech patterns are. 
    The goal of ScanScreen is to allow users the freedom to learn all known spoken and written languages in the world via the power of voice recognition as verbal communication is essential to both impaired and non-impaired users.
</p>     
    
    
    <p> DESIGN DESCRIPTION PROTOTYPE</p> 
</p> 
              

<p>    
    
    The system which my innovation project will be build on regarding the design prototype are iOS, meaning that it will only be available for Apple devices and users will be able to run the prototype by downloading the application via the AppStore available on all iOS devices.
</p>    
    
    
    
    
<p> DEMOGRAPHICS</p> 
    
 <p>   
    
    The demographics who would likely use ScanScreen would be academic students of all ages and levels from preschool to college students as well as working professionals and my student innovation pitch would benefit my demographics and audiences because of the cheaper costs of using the mobile application via yearly instead of monthly subscriptions and refunded cancellations if desired as well as being free to download to all mobile devices from IPhones to Androids. The technological and communication gaps my student innovation pitch fill are those for virtual communication and artificial intelligence by using voice recognition software between people worldwide. Similar mobile applications that currently exist on the technology market are Babbel, DuoLingo, Cake, and LingoKids that help with language fluency but not to the degree that my student innovation pitch does. 
    My student innovation pitch differs from what is already present and available in the current technology marketplace by recognizing voices only to learn languages.
